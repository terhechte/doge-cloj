# doge-cloj

A Clojure library designed to connect to the DogeCoinD API.
Still pretty untested and lacking good unit tests.

## Usage

Import it into your namespace

``` Clojure
(ns ...
    (:require
        [doge-cloj.core :as doge]
        [doge-cloj.config :as doge-config]
        ...
    ))
```

In order to work, the library needs to be initialized with the username and password 

``` Clojure
  (doge-config/set-config {:username "rpcuser"
                      :password "rpcpassword"})
```

Here, `rpcuser` and  `rpcpassword` are the dogecoind rpc login credentials that you defined in dogecoin.conf or that you set up on the commandline when starting dogecoind.

After this, you can just call the methods that are defined in core.clj

``` Clojure
(println (doge/getInfo))
```

## Unit Testing

If you want to unit test code that relies on calls from this library without starting and or stopping a dogecoind, you can bind `*mock-result*` to the value that you'd like to receive.

``` Clojure
(binding [ doge/*mock-result* {}]
      (let [results (core/call-that-relies-on-a-mock-result)]
        (is (= {} results))))
```

## Installation

`doge-clj` is available as a Maven artifact from [Clojars](http://clojars.org/doge-cloj):

In your project.clj;

``` Clojure
:dependencies [[doge-cloj "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
...]
```
